# HangmanGame
A simple and interactive console-based Hangman Game built using Python as part of my Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

# 📌 About The Project

This Hangman Game is my first internship project, assigned during my internship at CodeAlpha. The goal of this project was to strengthen programming fundamentals and apply problem-solving skills through practical development.
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player tries to discover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time within limited attempts.
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Python programming, logical thinking, and version control using Git & GitHub.

# ✨ Features:

🎯 Random word selection from predefined list

🔤 Letter-by-letter guessing

❤️ Limited lives system

✅ Correct & incorrect guess tracking

💻 Command-line interaction

🧠 Beginner-friendly logic

# Programming Concepts Used:

Variables & Data Types

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Loops (for, while)

Lists & Strings

Functions

Random Module

User Input Handling

# 🎮 How to Play:

The game selects a random word.

Guess one letter at a time.

Correct guesses reveal the word.

Wrong guesses reduce your lives.

Guess the word before lives run out to win!

# Chatbot_Project

A rule-based chatbot developed in Python that simulates human conversation using predefined logic and keyword-based responses.

# Project Overview

This project is a Rule-Based Chatbot developed to simulate human-like conversations by responding to user queries using predefined rules and keyword matching techniques. The chatbot is designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs), provide basic information, and demonstrate fundamental concepts of conversational AI and natural language processing logic.

The main objective of this project is to understand how chatbots work internally, including input processing, decision-making logic, and response generation without using complex machine learning models.

# 🎯 Key Features

Interactive text-based conversation system

Rule-based response mechanism using conditional logic

Predefined FAQ handling

User-friendly command-line interface

Error handling for unknown inputs

Expandable knowledge base (easy to add new questions and answers)

Clean and modular code structure

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Concepts Applied:

Conditional Statements

String Processing

Functions & Modular Programming

Basic NLP Logic (Keyword Matching)

# ⚙️ How It Works

The chatbot takes input from the user.

The program analyzes keywords or patterns in the sentence.

Matching rules are checked sequentially.

A predefined response is returned.

If no rule matches, a default response is displayed.
